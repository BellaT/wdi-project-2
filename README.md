###Introduction
Pitch is a festival finding app that allows the user to search through the database by either festival name, month, country and genre. 

###The ideas behind Pitch
I absolutely love going to festivals so I was really excited to produce an app that I would like to use to search for new festivals.  I had a clear vision in my head of what I wanted the site to look like and using Foundation and other design tools I have been able to accomplish this.
